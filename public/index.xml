        <description>&lt;p&gt;As an architectural intern at Michele Tonci Ottieri &amp;amp; Associati (MTOA), I contributed to the design and development of various projects, ranging from residential to commercial buildings, applying my knowledge and skills in landscape architecture, renewable energy, and green building. I graduated with a Master of Architecture degree from Sapienza Universit√† di Roma, where I focused on the integration of natural and artificial elements in urban and rural contexts. I also hold two certifications in renewable energy and green building entrepreneurship and construction project management from Duke University and Columbia University, respectively. Before joining MTOA, I worked as an interior designer at Acado Design, where l designed and implemented innovative and functional solutions for various clients, and as an AutoCAD operator at Zhiyar Beton Company, where I prepared and revised architectural drawings and documents. With more than three years of work experience in the architecture and design industry, I have developed strong competencies in project management, projectt, construction management, AutoCAD, SketchUp, and Revit. I am passionate about creating sustainable and resilient environments that enhance the quality of life and well-being of people and communities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
